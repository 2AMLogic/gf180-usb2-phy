"""Testbench manifests.

Testbenches follow the directory convention ratified in ``sim/README.md``:
each experiment gets ``sim/<experiment-slug>/`` and its testbench lives in
that experiment's ``testbench/`` subdirectory:

    sim/<experiment-slug>/testbench/tb.json            the manifest (this module)
    sim/<experiment-slug>/testbench/<something>.spice  a *netlist fragment*

The fragment must NOT contain ``.include`` of models, ``.lib``, ``.temp``,
``.control`` or ``.end``: the harness owns all of those so that one netlist
can be swept across the whole PVT grid without editing. The harness hands
the fragment these parameters:

    vdd_val   the supply for this PVT point (nominal, +tol or -tol)
    vdd_nom   the nominal supply, for ratio-style measurements
    temp_c    the temperature for this PVT point (also set via .temp)

plus anything in the manifest's ``params`` map.

A manifest may also name a **device under test**::

    sim/<experiment-slug>/testbench/tb.json   {"dut": "sim/dut/usb2_phy_driver.spice"}

The DUT is a second fragment holding nothing but ``.subckt`` definitions;
the harness ``.include``s it ahead of the testbench so several testbenches
share one netlist, and so the *same* testbench can be re-run against a
different netlist (a frozen copy, or a post-layout extracted netlist) with
``--dut <path>`` and no edit to the testbench at all. Which netlist a record
was taken against is carried in its **Netlist provenance** field.
